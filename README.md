E-commerce Order Fulfillment Operations Analysis – STAR Format

Situation

E-commerce order fulfillment operations were experiencing delays and inefficiencies, but there was no clear visibility into which stages of the fulfillment process were responsible or how frequently delays occurred.


---

Task

Analyze order fulfillment data to:

Understand order flow and outcomes

Identify delay and failure patterns

Quantify operational performance using measurable metrics

Highlight actionable areas for operational improvement



---

Action

Cleaned and structured raw order fulfillment data using Excel

Standardized order status and date fields for consistency

Analyzed order volumes and fulfillment outcomes (completed, delayed, failed)

Calculated key operational metrics such as delay rate and completion rate

Performed stage-wise analysis to identify where delays were introduced

Created summary tables and visualizations to support findings



---

Result

Identified that shipping and logistics stages contributed more to delays than internal order processing

Found a clear relationship between high order volume periods and increased delays

Highlighted that a small subset of orders accounted for a large share of delays

Provided clear, data-backed insights to prioritize early-stage process improvements

Demonstrated how focused operational fixes can significantly improve fulfillment reliability
