E-commerce Order Fulfillment Operations Analysis

📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes e-commerce order fulfillment operations data to evaluate how efficiently orders move from creation to completion. The focus is on identifying delay patterns, failure points, and operational bottlenecks using spreadsheet-based analysis.

The objective was not prediction or modeling, but operational clarity: understanding where and why fulfillment performance breaks down.


---

❓ Problem Statement

E-commerce operations often suffer from delayed or failed order fulfillment, but the root causes are unclear without structured analysis. This project addresses the lack of visibility by breaking down fulfillment performance across different operational stages.

🧠 What Was Done (Actual Work)

1. Data Preparation

Reviewed raw order fulfillment records

Cleaned inconsistent and missing values

Standardized order status and date fields

Filtered data to focus on relevant fulfillment outcomes



---

2. Operational Analysis

Analyzed total order volume and fulfillment outcomes

Compared completed, delayed, and failed orders

Measured delay frequency and distribution

Performed stage-wise analysis to identify delay contributors

Used summary tables and pivot-style analysis to extract insights



---

3. Metrics Calculated

Total orders processed

Order completion rate

Delay percentage

Failure rate

Average fulfillment duration

Stage-level contribution to delays



---

📊 Key Insights

Shipping and logistics stages contribute more to delays than internal order processing

High-volume order periods show increased fulfillment inefficiencies

A small subset of orders accounts for a disproportionate share of delays

Early-stage process improvements can significantly reduce downstream failures


These findings help prioritize operational fixes with maximum impact.

🛠 Tools Used

Microsoft Excel for data cleaning and analysis

CSV format for raw data storage

Markdown for documentation

Git and GitHub for version control



---

⚠️ Limitations

Analysis is descriptive, not predictive

Based entirely on historical data

Results depend on data quality and completeness



---

🚀 Future Improvements

Automate analysis using Python (pandas, matplotlib)

Use SQL for scalable data querying

Build an interactive dashboard (Power BI / Tableau)

Introduce predictive delay analysis
